== DESCRIPTION:

costagent is a Ruby gem that provides lightweight access to the projects/timeslips part of the FreeAgent API, with a view to tracking billable hours and figures.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

This isn't meant to be an entire Ruby library for the FA API - this is simply supposed to be a simple to use read-only view of timeslip data for keeping track of billable hours and calculating money earnt.

This assumes that when calculating money earnt, you want it in GBP, and it only copes with calculating timeslips either in GBP, or in USD (which is converted using xe.com where possible).

== SYNOPSIS:

To initialize:

costagent = CostAgent.new subdomain, username, password

(remember you need to enable API access from within your FreeAgent account)

To see all projects:

projects = costagent.projects

To find a specific project:

project = costagent.project(id)

To find timeslips:

timeslips = costagent.timeslips(start_date, end_date)

To return all tasks for a specific project:

tasks = costagent.tasks(project_id)

And to return a GBP figure of the money earnt during a specific timeframe based on billable hours:

total = costagent.earnt(start_date, end_date)

You can see the USD rate used for conversion:

CostAgent.usd_rate

This returns 1.6 if there is any error reaching or parsing xe.com. It's also stored once retrieved in a class variable so it doesn't keep querying everytime it's needed.

== REQUIREMENTS:

rest-client (1.5.0)
hpricot (0.8.2)

== INSTALL:

gem install costagent
